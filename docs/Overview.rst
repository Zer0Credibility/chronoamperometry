Overview
========

Installation
------------
pip install chronoamperometry

Purpose
-------
With the rapid generation of a large quantity of chronoamperometric data, the usual methods of data manipulation such
as MS Excel are not optimized for the large quantity of data generated by a potentiostat.

Also, there is a need for standardization of methods of analysis so that comparisons can be made between results
generated by different individuals. Additionally, programs such as MS Excel are limited in their capacity to do
complex analyses such as regression and more complicated statistics.

It is also my hope that this tool-set will assist with the goal of using MFCs to examine the underlying biology of
organisms by enabling comparison of mutants, etc.

Finally, this tool produces publication-quality graphs via the PlotNine package.


Tools
-----
This repository includes code that will:

1. Directly digest the output excel file from PalmSens MultiTrace potentiostat software.
2. Arrange the data into a standard dataframe format
3. Assist with statistical analysis for estimation of noise estimation and calculations for t-tests.
4. Plot the time series of raw chronoamperometric measurement using the python port of ggplot2, plotnine
5. Plot statistical or other analysis using plotnine

To do:

1. Calculations for cohen's D
2. Implement integral calculation for chronoamperometric curves
3. Calculations for sensitivity index d'
